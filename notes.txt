Setup:
1. rails generate clearance:install
2. rails db:migrate
3. rails generate clearance:routes
    3.1. Disable default routes, add this to config/initializers/clearance.rb:
        - config.routes = false

        If you don't you get this error: "Invalid route name, already in use: 'sign_in'  (ArgumentError)"
        From clearance's github page: "As of Clearance 1.5 it is recommended that you disable Clearance routes and take
        full control over routing and URL design. This ensures that your app's URL design won't be affected if the
        gem's routes and URL design are changed.

    4.1. add this line to config/initializers/clearance.rb:
